# node_React_MYSQL



Web application that manages organizational structure for parent and child companies.
Each company has two properties, they are company name and estimated annual earnings.
There are two types of companies: 1- Main company, 2 - Subsidiary company.
The company can belong only to one company but can have a few child companies.

I use sql + node.js + react

Opportunities
- The application should allow a user to view/add/edit/delete any company.
- Show companies tree
- Data about companies should be stored in database



in the process of development
